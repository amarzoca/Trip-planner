# Trippin
Webapp made for OxfordHack 2017. Finds an upcoming free weekend in the Google Calendar of the user and uses the SkyScanner API to find a cheap return trip during that weekend (user isn't required to pick a destination, the service finds the cheapest alternative with respect to the time constaints).

Command to run webapp: node server.js
